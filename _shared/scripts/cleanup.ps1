.SYNOPSIS
  Yazi suite - one-shot cleanup / reset ("clean slate" option).
  Used when /yazi-install fails partway, or the user wants to start over.
  - Backs up then removes the yazi config folder
  - Uninstalls yazi itself (only if scoop owns it; otherwise reports the path
    and refuses to guess-delete)
  - Leaves shared tools (git, ffmpeg, scoop itself, fonts) alone: they are
    harmless standalone and may be used by other things
  Prints what it did, plus optional removal commands for everything else.
  Ends with CLEANUP: DONE only when no yazi executable remains on PATH.
  Otherwise ends with CLEANUP: PARTIAL and returns exit code 1.
.NOTES
  Works on Windows PowerShell 5.1 and pwsh 7+.
