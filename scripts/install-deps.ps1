.SYNOPSIS
  Yazi Windows Rescue — dependency + Nerd Font check + install.
  Detects which yazi dependencies are present and installs ONLY the missing ones via scoop,
  then installs a Nerd Font so yazi's icons render (instead of tofu boxes).

.DESCRIPTION
  Run from PowerShell 7+ (pwsh) AFTER scoop is confirmed installed.
  - Prints each dependency as OK or MISSING (with what it's for).
  - Installs only the missing scoop packages (scoop skips anything already installed anyway).
  - Adds the 'nerd-fonts' bucket and installs a Nerd Font (Maple-Mono-NF-CN) if absent.
  - Auto-sets YAZI_FILE_ONE if not already configured.
  - Idempotent: safe to run more than once.

  Dependencies and the scoop package that provides each:
    yazi        -> yazi         (the file manager)
    fd          -> fd           (file search inside yazi)
    magick      -> imagemagick  (image previews)
    ffmpeg      -> ffmpeg       (video thumbnail previews)
    pdftoppm    -> poppler      (PDF previews)
    jq          -> jq           (JSON pretty previews)
    git         -> git          (provides file.exe used for MIME detection)
  Plus a Nerd Font:
    Maple-Mono-NF-CN -> nerd-fonts/Maple-Mono-NF-CN   (icons + CJK; what yazi draws in the file list)

.NOTES
  Designed for PowerShell 7+. If run on Windows PowerShell 5.1, it will explain
  how to get pwsh and exit gently (rather than throwing a #requires error).

  Font note: on Windows 10 (1809+) and Windows 11, fonts install for the current
  user WITHOUT admin rights. On older Windows, font install needs an elevated shell.
  Installing the font is necessary but NOT sufficient — the terminal must also be
  set to use that font (handled in SKILL.md Phase 4f).
